Inheritance
Task 1: Vehicle Start Behaviour Demonstration
Create a program that uses inheritance to show how different vehicle types override the same start() method.
Task 2: Create a multilevel inheritance program where `Car` extends `LandTransport`, which extends `Transport`, and each overrides the `move()` method to show transport evolution.
Task 3: Book Late Fee Calculation System
Use inheritance to show different book types overriding the late-fee calculation behaviour based on the number of delayed days.
Interface and Abstraction
Task 1: Design a media player system using both an interface and an abstract class. Begin by creating an interface named Playable that declares two methods: play() and pause(). Then, implement an abstract class called MediaFile that includes a String title field, a constructor to initialize the title, and a concrete implementation of the pause() method that prints a message indicating the media is paused. This abstract class should also declare an abstract method showDetails() to be implemented by subclasses. Create two subclasses: AudioFile and VideoFile, each providing their own implementation of play() and showDetails() to reflect their specific media type. In the main method, instantiate objects of both classes and demonstrate their functionality by calling all relevant methods.

Task 2:Create a course management system that combines interface and abstraction. Start by defining an interface named Enrollable with two methods: enroll() and complete(). Then, implement an abstract class called Course that includes a String courseName field, a constructor to initialize it, and a concrete complete() method that prints a message indicating the course has been completed. The abstract class should also declare an abstract method showContent() to be implemented by subclasses. Develop two subclasses: ProgrammingCourse and DesignCourse, each implementing the enroll() and showContent() methods with course-specific behavior. In the main method, create instances of both course types, enroll in them, and display their content and completion messages.

Task 3: Create an authentication system using abstraction where Admin and Guest classes override the abstract authenticate method to provide different login validation behaviours .The main method checks user input against both types to determine login success.
Encapsulation
Task 1: Student Details Encapsulation
Create a Student class that stores name and marks as private variables, and use getter and setter methods to update and display the student’s information securely.
Task 2:  Design a movie rating system using encapsulation principles. Create a class named Movie with three private fields: title, genre, and rating, where rating is a decimal value out of 10. Provide public getter and setter methods for each field, but ensure that the rating setter includes validation logic to allow only values between 0.0 and 10.0. Add a method called displayInfo() that prints all the movie details in a formatted way. In the main() method, create a few Movie objects, assign values using setters, and display their information using the displayInfo() method. This task helps reinforce the concept of encapsulation by restricting direct access to fields and enforcing controlled data updates through validation.
Task 3: Car Details Encapsulation
Create a Car class with private variables like model, year, and speed, and provide getter/setter methods that allow controlled access and ensure the speed cannot be set to a negative value.

Collection
Task 1: List Merger & Duplicate Remover
Merge two lists into one and remove duplicates using a Set to get unique sorted values.
Task 2 : Student List Manager 
Create a program that allows the user to enter multiple student names and stores them in a List<String>. After all names are entered, display the full list of students in alphabetical order. Then, prompt the user to input a name to search for and check if the student exists in the list using list.contains(name). If the student is found, print their position in the list (index). If not found, offer the user an option to add the new name to the list. Finally, display the updated list.
Task 3: Store all library books in a List and store borrowed books in a Set, then check whether a book is available by verifying if it is present in the borrowed set.
